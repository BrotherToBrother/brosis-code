    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>BroSis Code was created by someone with no formal coding background, no computer science degree, and no fancy titles ‚Äî just a deep desire to learn, create, and share freely with others.</p>

    <p>With the help of AI tools, we explore the world of programming, web development, and technology ‚Äî learning step-by-step, mistake-by-mistake, with honesty and transparency.</p>

    <p>BroSis Code is about building together ‚Äî brothers, sisters, anyone who believes that learning and helping should be free, open, and without hidden agendas. 
    We share what we discover, we lift each other up, and we keep growing ‚Äî without fear, without shame, and always with respect.</p>

    <p>Everything here is free. Everything here is built with heart and honesty. 
    You don't need to be an expert to start ‚Äî you just need the courage to try.</p>
