<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm not a professional developer. I don't have a computer science degree, and I didn't grow up building technology. 
    I simply had a deep desire to learn, create, and share freely with others.</p>

    <p>With the help of AI tools, I am exploring the world of programming, web development, and technology ‚Äî learning step-by-step, mistake-by-mistake, with honesty and transparency.</p>

    <p>BroSis Code is my way of building together ‚Äî welcoming brothers, sisters, and anyone who believes that learning and helping should be free, open, and without hidden agendas. 
    I share what I discover, I lift others up, and I keep growing ‚Äî without fear, without shame, and always with respect.</p>

    <p>Everything here is free. Everything here is built with heart and honesty. 
    You don't need to be an expert to start ‚Äî you just need the courage to try.</p>
